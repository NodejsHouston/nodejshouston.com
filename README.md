We need all the help we can get! You can also join in with our [community](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other Ghosters.


## Getting Started

There are a few different ways to install Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.

**Please note** - the downloadable zip files we provide on [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download), the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases), and via npm are pre-built packages designed for getting setup quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. 


### Install from zip (fastest & best for bloggers)

If you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible, this method is for you.

For detailed instructions on various platforms, visit the [Ghost Installation Guide](http://support.ghost.org/installation/). If you get stuck, help is available on [our support site](http://support.ghost.org/).

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.x**
1. Download the latest Ghost package from [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download). 
1. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and un-zip the package to that location.
1. Fire up a Terminal, the Node Command Prompt or shell and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)
1. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.
1. To start ghost, run `npm start`
1. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in

Check out the [Documentation](http://support.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.


### Install from git

If you're a developer or someone comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

Please do **NOT** use the master branch of Ghost in production. If you are using git to deploy to production, please use the latest [release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases) or the [stable](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/stable) branch which contains the latest release.

Full instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-ghost-core).

#### Quickstart:

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. `npm install`
1. `grunt init` (and `grunt prod` if you want to run Ghost in production mode)
1. `npm start`

Check out the [Documentation](http://support.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.


### Install from npm

If you want to build Ghost into a larger node app, or are familiar with using `npm` packages, then this method might be for you.

`npm install ghost`

Further setup instructions can be found in the [using Ghost as an npm module](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-an-npm-module) wiki entry.


### Upgrading to The Latest Version

Upgrade instructions can be found on the [Ghost Support Site](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/)


### Logging in For The First Time

Once you have the Ghost server up and running, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:2368/ghost/` from a web browser, where you will be prompted to setup your blog and user account. Once you have entered your desired credentials you will be automatically logged in to the admin area. The setup screen will not be accessible once the process has been completed.

* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
